# EKAW-24: Call for Workshops & Tutorials

The 24th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (EKAW-24) encompasses the diverse realms of eliciting, acquiring, modeling, and managing knowledge. 
The conference addresses the pivotal role of knowledge in constructing systems and services for the semantic web, knowledge management, knowledge discovery, information integration, natural language processing, intelligent systems, e-business, e-health, humanities, cultural heritage, and beyond. In particular, EKAW-24 emphasises the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Knowledge Engineering and Management.
Besides the regular conference tracks, EKAW will also host workshops and tutorials. 
EKAW Workshops provide an informal setting in which participants have the opportunity to discuss specific topics in an atmosphere that fosters the exchange of ideas via networking activities. 
EKAW Tutorials will enable attendees to fully engage in emerging methods and technologies relevant to knowledge representation and management, established schools of thought, and exciting application areas.

## Topics of Interest

In order to meet these goals, workshop/tutorial proposals should address topics that satisfy the following criteria:

- their topic falls within the general scope of EKAW 2024  (see: https://event.cwi.nl/ekaw2024/);
- there is a clear focus on any of the following:
  - Emergent technologies and methods in knowledge acquisition or management
  - New application domains or ways to rethink established ones
  - Novel problems in knowledge acquisition
  - Domain-oriented, interdisciplinary, or “blue-sky” research that may challenge established KR paradigms
  - there is a reference or growing research community interested in the topic
